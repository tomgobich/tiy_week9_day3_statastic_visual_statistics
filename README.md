# Statastics - Visual Statistics Using React

##### The Iron Yard - Week 9, Day 3

**The Stattleship API has moved to a trial basis - therefore unfortunately the API is no longer supported for this project. You can still preview the project to get a sense of how it was put together.**

Statastics displays NBA player statistics on a team basis. Using Statastics you can quickly determine a players usefulness to a team by comparing their salary, average minutes per game, and average game production. This information can then be used to build your fantasy team, determine trade likelihood, or even help manage your NBA 2k MyTeam.

This application was built on React and gathers data from [Stattleship](http://stattleship.com), an open sports API.
